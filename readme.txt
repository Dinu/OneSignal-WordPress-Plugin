Increase engagement and drive more repeat traffic to your WordPress site with desktop push notifications. Now supporting Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

== Description ==

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com) is a complete push notification solution for WordPress blogs and websites, trusted by over 15,500 developers and marketers including some of the largest brands and websites in the world.

After setup, your visitors can opt-in to receive desktop push notifications when you publish a new post, and visitors receive these notifications even after they’ve left your website.

We make it easy to configure delivering notifications at preset intervals, targeting notifications to specific users, and customizing the opt-in process for your visitors.

Features:

* **Supports Chrome** (Desktop & Android), **Safari** (Mac OS X), and **Firefox** (Desktop) on both HTTP and HTTPS sites.

* **Automatic Notifications** - Send notifications to followers every time you publish a new post. Or set up a reminder that gets automatically sent to them if they haven’t visited for a few days.

* **Targeting Segments** - Send notifications to specific visitors based on language, number of times they’ve visited your blog, or even set up your own user attributes that you can target.

* **Opt-In Customization** - Choose when and how to ask your visitors to opt-in to browser notifications. Customize the prompt they first see.

* **Real Time Analytics** - See your notifications being delivered in real time, and watch them as they convert into visitors.

* **A/B Testing** - Try out different messages to a smaller set of your visitors to figure out which messages are more effective and then send the more effective message to the rest of your visitors!

* **Scheduled Notifications** - Schedule notifications to be delivered in the future, based on a user’s time zone, or even based on the same time of day they last visited your website.

**All completely free. No fees or limitations.**
